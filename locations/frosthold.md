## Geography

Frosthold is situated high in the mountains of Skaldyr, surrounded by snow-covered peaks and towering cliffs. Icy winds whip through the city's streets year-round, and the snow rarely melts. The city is built on multiple levels, with stone bridges connecting various towers and buildings. The surrounding terrain is treacherous and unforgiving, making Frosthold both a fortress and a safe haven for its people.
