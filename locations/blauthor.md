## Geography

Blauthor is a fortress city perched atop the high cliffs of the Irathgar region, surrounded by dark forests and craggy mountains. The city is a commanding presence in the region, its towering fortifications and burnt remains visible from miles away. Its isolated position and strategic location once made it a powerful stronghold, but now, with many of its outer walls crumbled and its towers smoldering, the city has fallen into a state of disrepair. The path leading to Blauthor winds through a dense and fog-filled forest, adding to its foreboding nature.

## History

Blauthor was once a beacon of Irathgar's military might, its towering walls and strategic location making it nearly invincible. However, years of relentless war and siege left the city scarred and its people weary. The city withstood numerous attacks over the centuries, but its last siege, a devastating assault by a coalition of rival factions, broke much of its outer defenses. Though the invaders were repelled, Blauthor has never fully recovered from the damage. Now, it is a shadow of its former self, a place where the embers of war still burn amidst the ruins.

### Important Events

- **The Siege of Red Dawn**: A massive siege that saw Blauthor's outer walls breached for the first time. The defenders managed to hold the inner keep, but much of the city was left in ruins, setting the stage for Blauthor’s decline.
- **The Ashen Accord**: A pact forged between the remaining defenders and nearby towns, allowing Blauthor to serve as a refuge for those fleeing other conflicts in Irathgar. It also led to the formation of the Embered Shields, the city's last line of defense.
