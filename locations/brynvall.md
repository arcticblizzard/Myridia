## Geography

Brynvall is hidden deep within the boreal forests of Skaldyr, where massive ancient trees tower over the city. The settlement’s architecture harmonizes with the forest, as buildings are often built around or even within the trees, creating a feeling of unity with nature. The city is surrounded by thick mists and an ethereal atmosphere, making it difficult to locate unless one knows the hidden paths. Sunlight filters softly through the canopy, casting long beams of light through the misty air, illuminating the intricate woodwork of the buildings.

## History

Brynvall was established by a small group of settlers who revered the natural beauty and magic of the Skaldyr forests. Over the centuries, it grew slowly, with its inhabitants focusing on maintaining harmony with their surroundings rather than expanding outward. The city has developed a deep connection with the forest, and many of its citizens practice druidic arts. Due to its remote location and difficult-to-navigate terrain, Brynvall has remained largely free of external threats, and its isolation has allowed its culture to develop uniquely.
