## Geography

Rimeharbor is perched on the edge of a rocky coastline, with towering, snow-capped mountains forming a natural barrier behind it. The city's harbor is frozen much of the year, but large icebreaker ships allow trade and travel to continue. The harsh, icy winds and bitter cold define the city's environment, with a frozen sea extending beyond the harbor.
