## Geography

Mistreach is situated on a series of narrow, winding docks that extend out into the swirling waters of Calamity. The city’s architecture is a blend of towering spires, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. The air is always thick with mist, giving the city its name and adding to its atmosphere of intrigue.

## History

Mistreach was founded centuries ago as a refuge for those fleeing justice, and it quickly became a center for trade — both legal and illegal. The city’s strategic location, near the dangerous waters of the Calamity, made it a key stop for merchants and smugglers alike. Over time, Mistreach’s economy grew around its bustling port, and its leaders capitalized on the city’s foggy and mysterious nature to foster a haven for shadowy dealings. The constant mist, combined with the city’s narrow alleyways and labyrinthine streets, has made Mistreach a place of secrets, opportunity, and danger.
