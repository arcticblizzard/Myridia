## Geography

Ashhold is a ruined stronghold, carved into jagged cliffs, with crumbling towers and broken stone walls lining the city. The architecture of the city, once grand and impregnable, has been ravaged by years of warfare, disasters, and the harsh conditions of Calamity. The city is constantly cloaked in smoke, and the ever-present flames licking at its ruins give Ashhold its characteristic fiery glow. The remaining citizens of Ashhold cling to the remnants of their city, repurposing the ruins into makeshift homes and fortifications.

## History

Ashhold was once the seat of a powerful warlord, its walls impenetrable and its people proud. However, as the Calamity raged and external forces besieged the city, it slowly fell into ruin. The mighty stronghold became a graveyard of stone and ash, with only the most resilient of its population surviving the chaos. Over time, the city became a place for outcasts, scavengers, and mercenaries who found purpose amidst the ruins. The fires that continue to burn in the heart of Ashhold are both a reminder of its destruction and a symbol of its resilience.
