## Geography

Vrakheth is located on the edge of the inland waterways in the northern part of Nemedis, where the mist rolls off the mountains and swirls around the town. The town is built around a natural bay, which provides a safe harbor for the ships that brave the treacherous waters. The dark, weathered wood of the buildings blends into the cold, misty environment. The nearby mountains loom over the town, providing natural defense but also an air of isolation.
