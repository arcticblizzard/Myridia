## Geography

Aralai is built among the gigantic redwood trees of the Nemedis region. The village sits on a series of cascading cliffs where small waterfalls run through, creating natural bridges and levels throughout the settlement. The trees themselves tower over the buildings, creating a canopy that protects the village from harsh weather. The proximity to nature is a significant aspect of life in Aralai, with stone and wooden bridges connecting the homes built along the slopes and the roots of the redwoods.

The waterfalls have shaped both the landscape and the people of Aralai, who have learned to live harmoniously with nature. The village has always had a strong connection to the redwoods and the spirits that are said to inhabit them, and this connection has protected it from many external threats.
