## Geography

Vallencliff is nestled on a plateau high in the mountains of Irathgar. The settlement is naturally shielded by jagged rocks and cliffs, which form a natural barrier. The path leading to Vallencliff is narrow and treacherous, with only one road connecting it to the outside world. Snow blankets the region for most of the year, and the village is often shrouded in mist, providing an eerie and serene atmosphere. The city's inhabitants have built their homes from local stone and timber, blending into the rugged terrain.

## History

Vallencliff was founded by a group of settlers who sought isolation and freedom from the larger, war-torn regions of Irathgar. The settlement has remained small, with a tight-knit community that values peace and self-reliance. Over the years, Vallencliff has developed a reputation for its skilled woodcraft and the beauty of its fur trade, which are coveted by traders brave enough to make the journey. While the village is isolated, it holds strong cultural significance due to its unique location and spiritual connections to the mountains.
