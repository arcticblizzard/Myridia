## Geography

Hullgrave is a floating city constructed from the remains of hundreds of shipwrecks, each claimed by the destructive whirlpool that dominates Calamity. The city clings to the edges of the barren islands, built on scaffolding and the wrecked hulls of ships, with bridges made from ship masts connecting various sections. The air is thick with the smell of salt and tar, and the crashing waves beneath the city’s foundations are ever-present. At sunset, the city is bathed in a fiery orange light, creating a surreal and foreboding atmosphere.

## History

Hullgrave came into existence as a haven for those who sought refuge from the law or the dangers of the sea. Its founders were ship captains and pirates who survived the destructive whirlpool and banded together to create a place where they could rebuild their lives. Over time, the city grew as more wrecks washed ashore, and it became a lawless settlement where only the strongest survived. The city is a constant work in progress, with new ships being added to its structure as old ones are claimed by the sea.
