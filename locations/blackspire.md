## Geography

Blackspire is divided into two primary sections: the lower docks and shantytown, clinging to the cliffs and sea, and the upper city, where grand stone structures rise along the rocky plateau. The city’s name comes from the imposing black tower at its heart, which reaches skyward like a dark beacon. The city is shrouded in mist from the churning waters of the Calamity below, and the cliffs provide both a natural defense and a constant reminder of the dangers of the surrounding region.
