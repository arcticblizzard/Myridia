## Geography

Yragath is situated beneath a rugged mountainous region in Khorash, concealed behind a monumental entrance carved directly into the rocky cliffs. A long stone staircase descends from the surface, leading into the subterranean city, where the architecture of the city remains unseen to the outside world. Only the grand, intricately carved archway marks the entrance to this hidden metropolis, with few visitors ever knowing its location without guidance. Inside, the city is lit by bioluminescent flora, massive crystals embedded in the walls, and ancient dwarven engineering.

## History

Yragath was established centuries ago by a nomadic group of dwarves seeking refuge from the wars that ravaged the surface. The city was founded deep beneath the mountains, its entrance hidden from view, allowing the dwarves to thrive in isolation. Over the centuries, Yragath grew into a self-sustaining underground metropolis. The city's ability to mine precious minerals from the surrounding rock allowed it to flourish and establish trade with other cities in Khorash, even while remaining hidden from most of the world.
