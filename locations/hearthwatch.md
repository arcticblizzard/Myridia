## Geography

Hearthwatch is located in the shadow of the Skaldyr mountains, where icy winds sweep down from the peaks, and the ground is often frozen for much of the year. The village itself is built with sturdy wooden and stone structures to withstand the harsh climate, and the streets are narrow and often muddy. In the distance, snow-covered mountains frame the skyline, and a central tower serves as the watchpoint for travelers making their way into the village.

## History

Hearthwatch was founded by a group of hardy settlers seeking a place to live away from the larger coastal cities. Over the years, it became known as a safe haven for travelers and traders passing through the unforgiving Skaldyr mountains. The village has faced its share of challenges, from brutal winters to marauding bands, but has endured thanks to its self-reliant population and strong leadership.
