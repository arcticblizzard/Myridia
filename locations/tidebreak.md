## Geography

Tidebreak sits along a narrow bay, its once-mighty stone fortifications now crumbling into the sea. The remnants of towers and battlements cling to the cliffs, overgrown with vegetation and ravaged by years of neglect. The lower parts of the city are frequently flooded during high tides, with parts of the city submerged entirely, leaving only the upper ruins visible. The salty sea breeze and the constant sound of waves crashing against the decayed stonework are ever-present in this forlorn place.

## History

Tidebreak was once a bustling coastal city known for its trade routes and thriving port. Over the years, the waters of the Calamity began to creep in, flooding the lower parts of the city and destroying much of its infrastructure. Those who remained turned to scavenging and survival, eking out a living amidst the ruins. Tidebreak’s decline was hastened by constant attacks from pirates and raiders, drawn by the city’s weakening defenses and its strategic location along dangerous waters. Now, Tidebreak is a shadow of its former self, with only the desperate and the cunning choosing to stay.
