### Description

Once a bustling hub of trade, Slateport lies on the Southern Isle, a once-thriving maritime city now reduced to a remote and neglected backwater. Known for its abundant slate resources, the city's quarries were the backbone of its economy, fueling lucrative exports across Myridia. However, as trade routes shifted and the slate demand dwindled, Slateport fell into decline. Today, the city sees few ships docking at its run-down port, and the crumbling infrastructure reflects its waning importance.

The most prominent feature of Slateport is its keep, which was originally built into a massive granite hill on the outskirts of the city. This fortress has since been repurposed as an administrative center, overseeing the meager governance of the island's dwindling population. The once-proud city now clings to memories of its glory days, with few visitors and fewer prospects for revitalization.

### Geography

A relatively small island located in the sub-tropical south-west, the Island is dominated by large hills and seaward cliffs. Thanks to some of the arable land, a small population has been able to continue its existence long past the city's heyday.

### Statistics

| Population     | Economy           | Climate          |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| ~3,500         | Declining, Minimal | Humid, Coastal   |

### Key Landmarks

- **Slateport Keep**: Built into a granite hill, the keep was once the city's defensive stronghold. It now functions as the administrative center for the island's government.
- **Abandoned Slate Quarries**: The former heart of the city's economy, these quarries are now ghostly remnants of Slateport's past, with overgrown paths and derelict equipment.
- **Run-Down Port**: The once-thriving port is now a decaying shadow of its former self, rarely seeing new ships dock in its worn and battered harbor.

### Leadership

- **Governor Kaelan Voss**: A weary and pragmatic leader, Kaelan oversees the island with little hope of reversing its decline. He’s more concerned with maintaining order than pursuing any grand visions for Slateport’s revival.

### History

Slateport was founded centuries ago when rich deposits of slate were discovered in the hills surrounding the city. The island became known for its vast quarries, and Slateport’s natural harbor made it a key shipping center in the southern seas. For decades, ships from all over Myridia came to trade, and the city flourished. However, as the slate market dwindled and newer, faster trade routes bypassed the island, Slateport’s prosperity began to wane. The island slowly became isolated, with only a skeleton population remaining to manage the decline.
