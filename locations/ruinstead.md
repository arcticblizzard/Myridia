## Geography

Ruinstead lies in a desolate valley surrounded by towering cliffs in the rugged lands of Irathgar. The village is remote, with only a few pathways leading into the region. The dilapidated wooden buildings and structures, some of which have collapsed over time, blend into the dark and fog-covered landscape. The natural isolation provided by the rocky environment makes Ruinstead a quiet, almost forgotten place.

## History

However, a series of natural disasters and isolation over the years led to the village's decline. With its population dwindling, the village now serves as a refuge for those who seek to escape the outside world. Ruinstead's history is marked by its survival despite the hardships imposed by the land.

- **The Return of the Wardens**: A group of hunters returned to Ruinstead after years of living in the wild, reinvigorating the village with their knowledge of survival.
