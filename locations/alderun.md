## Geography

Alderun is a city built directly into the rocky mountains of Irathgar. Its architecture merges with the natural rock, creating towering stone fortresses that loom over the landscape. The steep cliffs and winding roads make access to the city difficult, enhancing its defenses. Clouds frequently envelop the city, and the high elevation brings cold winds and a thin atmosphere. Many of the city’s walkways and buildings are supported by massive arches cut directly into the mountain, showcasing incredible engineering and endurance through time.
