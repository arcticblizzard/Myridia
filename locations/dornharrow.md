## Geography

Dornharrow sits atop a solitary hill that rises steeply from the surrounding landscape. The city's stone walls and fortress give it an intimidating presence, looming over the valleys and forests of northern Caelvorn. The region is often shrouded in mist, adding to the air of mystery and isolation that surrounds the city. Rugged terrain and narrow paths make the stronghold difficult to approach, providing both natural and man-made defenses.
