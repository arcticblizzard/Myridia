## Geography

Stalvorn is situated in the high cliffs of the Skaldyr mountains, surrounded by perpetual snow and ice. The stronghold is built into the rock face, with narrow paths leading up the mountain to its gates. The city's location provides both natural defenses and a breathtaking view of the snow-covered valleys below. A massive spire of stone rises from the city’s heart, standing as both a watchtower and a symbol of its indomitable spirit. The surrounding landscape is harsh, with constant snowstorms battering the city, making Stalvorn one of the most isolated places in Skaldyr.

## History

Stalvorn was founded centuries ago by a coalition of warriors, traders, and exiles fleeing conflicts in warmer lands. They found the mountain cliffs of Skaldyr to be a perfect natural defense and began construction of their stone stronghold. Over time, Stalvorn grew into a thriving bastion of northern resilience. The spire, originally constructed as a watchtower, became a symbol of the city's defiance in the face of overwhelming odds, whether from invaders or the brutal elements. Despite its remote location, the city continues to thrive through resourceful mining operations and its position as a waypoint for travelers seeking refuge from the storms.
