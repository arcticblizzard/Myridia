## Geography

Glacierdeep sits in a desolate, frozen valley surrounded by towering cliffs and the ever-encroaching blue ice of a massive glacier. The icy terrain is both a barrier and a resource, as the city’s economy thrives on the mining of prismatic gems found deep within the ice. The city itself is built into the rock of the valley walls, with pathways carved through the ice leading to the mines.

## History

Glacierdeep was founded when explorers stumbled upon the prismatic gems embedded in the glacier's ice. This discovery led to a steady influx of miners, traders, and artisans seeking fortune. Over time, the city established itself as the sole supplier of these valuable gems, which are sought after by powerful individuals and empires across the realm. The inhospitable conditions and the strategic location near the glacier make Glacierdeep a difficult place to reach, adding to its mystique.
