## Geography

Stoneholt lies deep beneath the mountains of Skaldyr, carved into the very bedrock of the region. The city is defined by colossal stone arches that support vast caverns, where buildings rise up like jagged teeth. While most of the city is built into the stone, lush rooftop gardens have been cultivated through the use of artificial sunlight created by powerful dwarven engineering. These gardens not only provide food but also serve as a reminder of the surface world to the citizens who spend their lives beneath it.

Over time, the dwarves mastered the art of growing food underground, using artificial sunlight powered by their advanced engineering.
