## Geography

Rasha-Nur is built within a dense forested region of Thal-Zora, its streets winding through towering structures that seem to merge with the surrounding vegetation. The city’s architecture is a blend of old and new, with ancient buildings covered in ivy standing beside newer structures, all hidden beneath a thick canopy of trees. The city’s isolation has led to its reputation as a place of mystery, where travelers are rarely welcomed.
