## Geography

Elyndor sits in the heart of Irathgar's mountainous terrain, nestled atop a high peak. The city is renowned for its soaring bridges, steep pathways, and awe-inspiring views. The magic school, 'Arathis Academy,' is located on a floating island tethered by a long, arching bridge that stretches across a deep gorge.

## History

Elyndor was founded centuries ago as a secluded sanctuary for the study of magic. Over time, it grew into a well-known hub of arcane knowledge, attracting students and teachers from across the world. The construction of the Span of Aether, which connected the city to the floating island that houses Arathis Academy, was considered one of the greatest magical achievements of its time. The city’s location, high in the mountains, provides both protection and isolation, making it a refuge for those seeking mastery of the arcane arts.

### Important Events

- **The Sealing of the Span**: Centuries ago, after a devastating battle with rogue mages, the bridge to Arathis Academy was sealed by Archmage Delyn Kerren’s predecessor for five decades to prevent the misuse of its magical secrets.
- **The Floating Island War**: A brief but intense conflict between rival schools of magic, where an attempted invasion of Elyndor was thwarted thanks to the magical defenses of Arathis Academy.
