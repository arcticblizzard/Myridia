## History

Velsara has long stood as a bastion of strength and prosperity in Khorash. Originally a small fortress, the city's population and power grew as it became a hub for trade and agriculture. The city's unique location on the cliff allowed it to resist numerous invasions and raids throughout its history, and its fortifications have been expanded over centuries to ensure its continued dominance. The terraces below the city provide a steady source of food, while the citadel itself serves as a vital strategic point for both trade and defense. Velsara's economy is further bolstered by the stone quarries in the nearby mountains, providing high-quality materials for both local use and export.
